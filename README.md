# Emacs Bedrock

Stepping stones to a better Emacs experience

**NOTICE:** This is a placeholder repository for people who like to start things on GitHub. See the [project homepage](https://codeberg.org/ashton314/emacs-bedrock) for the source.

## Synopsis

An *extremely* minimal Emacs starter kit uses just one external package by default, and only GNU-ELPA packages on an opt-in basis. Intended to be copied once and then modified as the user grows in knowledge and power.
